# Roadmap

- [ ] Support the formatting of different kinds of time periods (not just years)
- [ ] Add more time period formats (horizontal, different columns)
- [ ] Add a CLI and make it behave a little like Unix's `cal`
- [ ] Support different calendar types (Julian, etc)
- [ ] Support for themes, perhaps with a plugin extension `calendario-themes` that depends on the `pastel` gem
